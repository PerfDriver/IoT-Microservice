###Description
This folder contains material for a one-day hands-on lab seminar that takes the Home Biomedical solution and upgrades the IoT sub-system to leverage IoT Hub instead of Event Hub. In addition, it demonstrates a deployment approach that places all resources in the solution into a single Resource Group.

###Features
 - Updated Automation Scripts for shared data services and microservices
 - Manual configuration of IoT Hub and Stream Analytics as a learning exercise
 - DocumentDb as a Stream Analytics Sync
